                    <p class="lead mb-5">The twentieth century brought written literature to Arunachal Pradesh. The embrace of modern education stirred the artistic zeal in a few fertile minds and after 1947 we began to see the writings of authors such as Tagang Taki, Lummer Dai, YD Thongchi, Rinchin Norbu Moiba, Samuru Lunchang and Kensam Kenglam. They were the first generation of literary luminaries from Arunachal. Lummer Daiâ€™s debut novel Pharor Xile Xile (1961) could perhaps be considered the first novel of Arunachal Pradesh, written by an Arunachali.

                    <p class="lead mb-5">Arunachal Pradesh exhibits massive cultural diversity when it comes to clothing. Being essentially a tribal state, there are many tribes and each have their own set of traditions and customs. This is reflected in the distinct clothing styles. While most of them are ethnically similar, they have different origins of their clothing. Mostly, they have derived the most style of clothing from their ancestors. The geographical separation has brought in the other little changes in the styling. The tribes in Arunachal Pradesh are known for weaving, which is also why the handloom industry is a thriving industry there. Aptami tribe have been progressing with advanced techniques. The tribal people prefer wearing indigenous organic materials only. The raw materials used are basically goat hair, human hair, tree barks etc. Using all these, they create skirts, shawls, ceremonial coats, etc. The colours preferred by the local craftsmen are dark blue, scarlet, yellow, emerald, black etc. The origin of these colours are natural dyes, extracted from trees, flowers, barks and seeds. The skull caps known as Gurdams worn by the Monpa tribe are made of yak hair. The men of Adi tribe wear helmets carved out of deer and bearskins and canes. The accessories of women, although different for all tribes, commonly use bamboo bits available in plenty in the state.</p>

                    <p class="lead mb-5">Dance and music are an essential part of the life of Arunachali tribes. They dance and sing on important occasions and during the time of festivities and weddings. Various dance forms are seen in different parts of Arunachal. From elaborate religious dance dramas of the Buddhists to the martial arts and colourful dance performances of the Noctes and Wanchos, dance forms of Arunachal come in various formats. They can broadly be divided into four categories- Festive Dances, Ritual Dances, Recreational Dances and Dance Dramas.

Some popular folk dances in Arunachal Pradesh are Aji Lamu, Chalo, Hiirii Khaniing, Popir, Ponung, Pasi Kongki, Rekham Pada, Roppi, Lion and Peacock dance. Most of the dance forms are accompanied by chorus songs.

                    <p class="lead mb-5">Arunachal Pradesh is situated in the farthermost north-eastern border of India. The influence of tribal communities and nearby Himalayan civilisations is quite evident in the local cuisine. Rice and meat are the staple food of Arunachal. Lettuce is quite popular among locals and it is cooked using green chillies, coriander and ginger. Boiled rice cakes, Thukpa and momos are the traditional dishes devoured by people. The food is less on spices and is generally mild. Various forms of rice beers are prepared by local communities, one of them being Apang which is prepared by fermenting rice and millet. Due to the high amount of variedness among local communities, the food preparation methods differ slightly from district to district.

                    <p class="lead mb-5">Solung is the most popular festival of the Adis of Arunachal Pradesh which is celebrated on September 1 every year. Though primarily an agro-based festival, it also reflects the socio-religious features of the people.

There are three main parts in the celebration of this festival. They are:

I. Sopi---Yekpi ( also called Limir-Libom), the first part and the sacrificial day; II.Binnyat, the second part, the ritual offering to goddess of crops, Kine Nane, and III.Ekop (also called Taktor), the ritual made for protection against harms by evil spirits by appeasing to Gumin-Soyin, the household guardian, and Doying Bote, god of wisdom and human welfare. Ardo-Bado is the sacrificial and inaugural day in Solung celebration. According to the Sopi-Yekpi Aabang (the lyrical rhapsody of Adi myth and belief of creation), Mithun or Eso is the first animal to appear in the world which Dadi Bote, god of domestic animals, nurtured and gifted to human beings.

Mithun, a valuable possession of the people, symbolizes prosperity of both individual and the society. It is also considered a holy animal by the people and, therefore, occupies an important religious significance. They pray to Dadi Bote for his kindness to them and appease him for bestowing good fortune to them and also for safety of all domestic animals.

Binnyat, the second part of Solung, is the ritual offering made by women-folk to goddess of crops, Kine Nane in fields for protection of crops against epidemics and bestowing of bumper harvest. Aabangs describe it is Kine Nane who gifted crop seeds to humans in the beginning and gave them the knowledge of performing of festivals. On this occasion people acknowledge their gratefulness to Kine Nane and solicit her for boons of family welfare and prosperity.
