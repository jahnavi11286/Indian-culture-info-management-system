                     Nannaya, Tikkana, Yerrapragada, Srinatha, Molla, and Tarikonda Venkamamba made the Telugu language alluring- 
                     a lingua franca for religion, musical composition and philosophy. The contributions of Charles Phillip Brown, 
                     Vemana, Sri Sri and Viswanatha Satyanarayana made Telugu a vibrant and evolving modern language. 
                     The contributions of various Telugu/Tamil/Sanskrit grammarians to the formalisation of English grammar 
                     gave Telugu literary traditions a truly global reach.
Telugu literature is highly influenced by Sanskrit literature and Hindu scriptures. Nannayya, Tikkana, and Yerrapragada form the
 trinity who translated the great epic Mahabharatha into Telugu. 
 Bammera Potana is another great poet from Vontimitta (Kadapa district), 
 famous for his great classic Sri Madandhra Maha Bhagavatamu, a Telugu translation 
 of Sri Bhagavatam (authored by Veda Vyasa in Sanskrit). Nannayya derived the present Telugu 
 script (lipi) from the old Telugu-Kannada script. Emperor Krishna Deva Raya wrote and also made the famous statement: 
 "Desha Bhashalandu Telugu lessa" meaning "Telugu is the sweetest among all Indian languages". Famous Tamil poet
  Mahakavi Bharathiyar wrote "Sundhara telungunil paatisaithu", which literally means "create songs in beautiful Telugu".
   Philosophical poems by Yogi-Vemana are quite famous. Modern writers include Jnanpith Award winners Sri Viswanatha 
   Satya Narayana and Dr. C. Narayana Reddy. Revolutionary poets like SriSri and Gaddar are popular.</p>

                     fashion and dying traditions of the world. Its rich cotton production, with its innovative
                      plant dye extraction history stand next to its diamond mining, pearl harvesting and jewelry
                       traditions to form an impressive fashion tradition that has stood the test of time.
                        The ancient Kollur mine is the mother of the numerous legendary gems such as the Koh-i-Noor and Hope Diamond.
                         Andhra Pradesh had a virtual monopoly in the global jewelry industry till 1826
                          (founding of the diamond mines in Rhodesia, Africa) and eight of the ten most valuable jewelry pieces on earth
                           today trace their history back to Andhra Pradesh.
                            Langa-Voni (Half saree), Sarees made in Kalamkari, Bidri, Nirmal paintings,
                             fascinating weaves from Pochampalli, Gadwal, Venkatagiri are the result of
                              this 3000-year-old fashion tradition. Vaddaanam, Aravanke, Kashulahaaram, Buttalu 
                              and various standard gold jewelry designs are fine examples of this continuously evolving 
                              ancient tradition.</p>

                    <p class="lead mb-5">Jayapa Senani (Jayapa Nayudu) was the first known author to write about the dance forms prevalent in Andhra Pradesh.
                    [4] Both Desi and Margi forms of dance have been included in his Sanskrit treatise Nritya Ratnavali, 
                    which contains eight chapters. Folk dance forms like Perani, Prenkhana, Suddha Nartana, Carcari, Rasaka,
                     Danda Rasaka, Shiva Priya, Kanduka Nartana, Bhandika Nrityam, Carana Nrityam, Chindu, Gondali and Kolatam
                      are described. In the first chapter the author discusses the differences between Marga and Desi, Tandava 
                     and Lasya, Natya and Nritta. In the second and third chapters, he deals with Angi-Kabhinaya, Caris, Sthanakas
                      and Mandalas. In the fourth chapter, Karnas, Angaharas and Recakas are described. In the following chapters,
                       he describes local dance forms, e.g., Desi Nritya. In the last chapter, he deals with the art and practice 
                       of dance.
Classical dance in Andhra can be performed by both men and women; nowadays,
 women tend to learn it more often. Traditionally it was done by men and female temple dancers. 
 Women did not dance it in public, and men played female parts in Kuchipudi ballets. As time went by, women began
  to learn it as an art as well. This started when women danced in kings' courts. Kuchipudi is the best-known classical 
  dance form of Andhra Pradesh. The various dance forms that existed through the state's history are Chenchu Bhagotam, 
  Kuchipudi, Bhamakalapam, Burrakatha, Veeranatyam, Butta bommalu, Dappu, Tappeta Gullu, Dhimsa, and Kolaatam.</p>

                     taste and spicy flavours. Plenty of red chilli is cultivated in the lands of Andhra Pradesh and Telengana. 
                     Naturally, the spices have dominance in the recipes of the local food. If you are new to the world of chillis
                      and spices, then please do sit down to eat with a bowl of jaggerry or glass of butter-milk to soothe your 
                      tongue every now and then. Else, it can get quite torturous.</p>
